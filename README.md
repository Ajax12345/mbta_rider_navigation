# MBTA Rider Diagnostics Dashboard

This project is designed to serve as a tool for MBTA riders to identify troublesome stops, line bottlenecks, and determine the most likely delay times that they will have to endure as they make their way towards a particular stop. The visualization contains a series of line schematics with their associated stops, color-coded to convey the average delay that each sees, on average, every day. Also, the tool comes equipped with a live train tracker: users can select the desired line and see the progress of any commuter rail trains on that line, in real time, with a simple statistics table that provides an estimate for the arrival time.

Lastly, the visualization concludes with visualizations of historical reliability statistics for the entire commuter rail. These plots clearly convey the fact that the overall reliability of the MBTA has been increasing steadily over the past four years, which I hope will give commuters a renewed hope and optimism for the future of the MBTA.
